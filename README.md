Overview


The AI-Powered Mock Interview System is an innovative application designed to help users prepare for technical interviews. The system uses advanced AI algorithms to simulate realistic interview scenarios, offering users personalized feedback on their responses. It aims to improve interview performance by providing real-time suggestions and constructive critiques.


Features




AI-based Question Generation: The system generates relevant questions based on the user's profile and interview stage (e.g., software engineering, data science).




Speech Recognition: Analyzes spoken responses for accuracy, clarity, and relevance.




Real-time Feedback: Provides instant feedback on the userâ€™s responses, pointing out areas for improvement.




Customizable Interview Modules: Users can select specific modules (e.g., coding questions, behavioral questions, etc.).




Progress Tracking: Keeps track of performance over time, showing areas that need further practice.




Tech Stack




AI/ML: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for question generation and response analysis.




Backend: Python, Flask for backend services.




Frontend: React.js for the user interface.




Speech Recognition: Google Speech API or SpeechRecognition library.




Database: Firebase (for storing user data and progress tracking).
